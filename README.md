## Getting Started 🚀

You must have Flutter installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
And you must have an **iOS or Android** emulator or a physical device connected to your machine.

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# set the FLAVOR=<development, staging, or production>
$ FLAVOR=development; flutter run --flavor $FLAVOR --target "lib/main_$FLAVOR.dart" --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev
```

_\*Very Good Coffee App works on iOS and Android only._
